# Convex Hull Problem!

  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  Given a few points in 2D plane, create a hull(boundary)!

  <h2> Required Material </h2>
    0. gcc </br>
    1. A txt file with the points of a polygon. (Example shown below)
    2. Your txt file should be inside the 'input' folder!

  <h2>Run instructions </h2>
    0. Downlaod this zip file </br> 
    1. Open Terminal </br>
    2. Type: cd pointInPolygon/src </br>
    3. Type: gcc main.cpp  Point.cpp Edge.cpp Polygon.cpp -lstdc++ -o main.o </br>
    4. Type: ./main.o
    4. Enter the name of your input file which as a polygon in it </br>
    5. Enter the x-cordinate of your input point </br>
    6. Enter the y-cordinate of your input point </br>
    7. Enjoy!

  <h2>Notes": </h2>
    0. This program was built using C++ & smart pointers </br>
    1. The input file describing the polygon should be in a specific format as shown below </br>
    2. Output will be visible on the terminal
    3. 2 = point is on the edge </br>
    4. 1 = point is inside the polygon </br>
    5. 0 = point is outside the polygon </br>
